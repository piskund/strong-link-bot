# Strong Link 🏆

A Telegram quiz bot inspired by the classic “Weakest Link” format. Strong Link runs full-length tournaments in group chats, guiding players through themed tours, timed rounds, score tracking, and eliminations until champions emerge.

## Features

- **Structured Quiz Tournaments**: 8 configurable tours with 10 rounds each, per-spec scoring and elimination mechanics
- **Multi-language Play**: Russian (default) and English interfaces, with localized prompts and help
- **Flexible Question Sources**: AI-generated trivia via OpenAI or curated packs fetched from the ЧГК (ChGK) database
- **Persistent Game State**: JSON-backed storage for state recovery and exporting final results
- **Telegram-native UX**: Command-driven controls, auto-messaging, and real-time scoreboard updates in group chats

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 9.0+
- Telegram Bot Token (from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather))
- Optional: OpenAI API key for AI question mode

### 2. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/strong-link-bot
cd strong-link-bot

# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Configuration

1. Copy the environment template:

```bash
copy env_template.txt .env
```

2. Update `.env` with your keys:

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here # optional if using AI questions
```

3. Configure runtime options with `appsettings.json` as needed:

```json
{
  "Bot": {
    "DefaultLanguage": "ru",
    "QuestionSource": "AI"
  },
  "Game": {
    "Tours": 8,
    "RoundsPerTour": 10,
    "AnswerTimeoutSeconds": 30,
    "EliminateLowest": 1
  },
  "OpenAi": {
    "Model": "gpt-5.2",
    "AnswerValidationModel": "gpt-4o-mini"
  }
}
```

**Configuration Precedence:**
Strong Link uses multiple configuration sources with the following precedence (later sources override earlier ones):

1. `appsettings.json` - Default values
2. `appsettings.Development.json` - Development-specific values (if exists)
3. `.env` file - Environment variables (use `SECTION__PROPERTY` format, e.g., `OPENAI__MODEL=gpt-5.2`)
4. System environment variables
5. Command line arguments

**Example:** If you set `"Model": "gpt-4o-mini"` in `appsettings.json` but also set `OPENAI__MODEL=gpt-5.2` in `.env`, the bot will use `gpt-5.2`.

### 4. Run the Bot

```bash
dotnet run --project StrongLink.Worker
```

### Standalone Demo (no Telegram required)

```bash
dotnet run --project StrongLink.Worker -- --standalone
```

Runs a short 3-tour demo against simulated players (default 45% accuracy).

## Getting Bot Credentials

### Telegram Bot Token
- Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
- Run `/newbot` and follow the instructions
- Copy the generated bot token into your `.env`

### OpenAI API Key (AI mode)
- Visit [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- Create or reuse an API key with sufficient quota
- Update `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`

## Usage

### Primary Commands
- `/start` – Initialize game session and announce setup instructions
- `/join` – Players join the pending game lobby
- `/prepare_pool` – Generate questions with OpenAI (admin only)
- `/fetch_pool` – Download questions from the ChGK database (admin only)
- `/begin` – Start the tournament once the pool is ready (admin only)
- `/standings` – Show live leaderboard and statuses
- `/help` – Detailed help and command summary
- `/stop` – Cancel the current game (admin only)

### Gameplay Flow
1. Admin runs `/start` to prepare the lobby
2. Players opt in with `/join`
3. Admin prepares questions via `/prepare_pool` (AI) or `/fetch_pool` (ChGK)
4. Admin launches the game with `/begin`
5. Strong Link rotates through players, sends questions, scores answers, and eliminates low scorers after each tour
6. Upon completion, the bot announces winners and automatically finalizes the game

### Game Finalization
When a game ends (either by completion or `/stop` command), Strong Link automatically:
- **Archives game results** to `data/results/` with full statistics, player scores, and used questions
- **Archives used questions** to prevent reuse in future games
- **Clears the session** to allow starting a new game immediately
- **Preserves unused questions** in the pool for future games

You can start a new game right after the previous one ends using the remaining questions in the pool.

## Cost Optimization with Dual Models

Strong Link supports using different OpenAI models for different tasks to optimize cost:

- **Question Generation** (`Model`): Use powerful models like `gpt-5.2` or `gpt-4o` for high-quality, creative questions
- **Answer Validation** (`AnswerValidationModel`): Use cheaper models like `gpt-4o-mini` for simple yes/no validation

**Example configuration:**
```json
"OpenAi": {
  "Model": "gpt-5.2",              // Powerful model for question generation
  "AnswerValidationModel": "gpt-4o-mini"  // Cheap model for answer checking
}
```

This approach significantly reduces costs since:
- Question generation happens once per game (10-80 questions)
- Answer validation happens every player response (potentially hundreds of times)

Using `gpt-4o-mini` for validation instead of `gpt-5.2` can reduce answer validation costs by ~10-20x while maintaining accuracy.

## Configuration Options

| Section | Option | Description | Default |
|---------|--------|-------------|---------|
| `Bot` | `DefaultLanguage` | `ru` or `en` | `ru` |
| `Bot` | `QuestionSource` | `AI` or `Chgk` | `AI` |
| `Game` | `Tours` | Total tours per tournament | `8` |
| `Game` | `RoundsPerTour` | Rounds (full player rotations) per tour | `10` |
| `Game` | `EliminateLowest` | Players removed after each tour | `1` |
| `Game` | `UseAiAnswerValidation` | Use AI for flexible answer checking | `true` |
| `Game` | `Topics` | Optional custom topics per tour | Default set |
| `OpenAi` | `Model` | OpenAI model for question generation | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| `OpenAi` | `AnswerValidationModel` | OpenAI model for answer validation (optional, uses `Model` if not set) | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| `Chgk` | `RandomEndpoint` | Source endpoint for ЧГК questions | `https://db.chgk.info/xml/random` |

## Troubleshooting

**Bot not responding:**
- Verify `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
- Confirm the bot is added to the group and privacy mode is disabled
- Check console output for startup errors

**Question preparation fails:**
- Ensure OpenAI key is set when using AI mode
- Confirm network access to `db.chgk.info` when using ChGK mode
- Review error messages in chat (localized to game language)

**Game won’t start:**
- Make sure at least two players joined via `/join`
- Confirm a question pool was prepared (`/prepare_pool` or `/fetch_pool`)

## Data Storage

Strong Link maintains several data directories:
- `data/state/` - Active game sessions (automatically cleared after game ends)
- `data/results/` - Archived game results with statistics and player scores
- `data/pool/` - Question pool database (unused and archived questions)

## Privacy and Ethics
- Only stores minimal game state for active tournaments
- Results archives saved locally under `data/results/` with timestamps
- Used questions archived separately to prevent reuse
- Designed for group entertainment and educational purposes
- No personal data persists beyond gameplay metadata (Telegram IDs and display names)
