# Strong Link 🏆

A Telegram quiz bot inspired by the classic “Weakest Link” format. Strong Link runs full-length tournaments in group chats, guiding players through themed tours, timed rounds, score tracking, and eliminations until champions emerge.

## Features

- **Structured Quiz Tournaments**: 8 configurable tours with 10 rounds each, per-spec scoring and elimination mechanics
- **Multi-language Play**: Russian (default) and English interfaces, with localized prompts and help
- **Flexible Question Sources**: AI-generated trivia via OpenAI or curated packs fetched from the ЧГК (ChGK) database
- **Persistent Game State**: JSON-backed storage for state recovery and exporting final results
- **Telegram-native UX**: Command-driven controls, auto-messaging, and real-time scoreboard updates in group chats
